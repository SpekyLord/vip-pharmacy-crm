## Overview

Full ERP system under `backend/erp/` and `frontend/src/erp/`. Multi-entity pharmaceutical distribution ERP with SAP-inspired patterns.

### Architecture
- **Multi-entity**: VIP (parent) + MG AND CO. (subsidiary). Entity-scoped data via `req.entityId`.
- **Document lifecycle**: DRAFT → VALID → ERROR → POSTED (SAP Park→Check→Post)
- **MongoDB transactions** for all posting operations
- **Double-entry accounting**: JournalEntry model with DR=CR validation on pre-save
- **Period locking**: `checkPeriodOpen()` prevents posting to closed months

---

## Entity Model

VIP is the parent company, supplies subsidiaries (MG AND CO. INC. first). BDMs can graduate to own subsidiary. Scalability is critical — every model is scoped by `entity_id`.

- `req.entityId` — resolved from user's assigned entity
- `req.bdmId` — the BDM user (for BDM-scoped queries)
- `req.tenantFilter` — `{ entity_id: req.entityId, bdm_id: req.bdmId }` (convenience)

## Accounting Engine (Phase 11)

### Auto-Journal on POST

Every submit/post controller creates journal entries via `autoJournal.js` → `journalEngine.createAndPostJournal(entityId, jeData)`. JE creation is non-blocking (after MongoDB transaction, wrapped in try/catch).

### JE Reversal on REOPEN

All reopen functions call `journalEngine.reverseJournal()` (SAP Storno pattern: creates a new JE with flipped DR/CR amounts, original stays POSTED, reversal links via `corrects_je_id`). VAT/CWT ledger entries cleaned up on reopen.

### COA Mapping

| Transaction | Debit | Credit |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Sale (CSI) | 1100 AR Trade | 4000 Revenue + 2100 VAT |
| COGS | 5000 COGS | 1200 Inventory |
| Service Revenue | 1100 AR Trade | 4100 Service Revenue |
| Collection | Cash/Bank (resolved) | 1100 AR Trade |
| CWT | 1220 CWT Receivable | 1100 AR Trade |
| SMER | 6100/6150/6160/6170 | 1110 AR BDM |
| Car Logbook | 6200 Fuel | 1110 or funding COA |
| Expenses ORE | line.coa_code | 1110 AR BDM |
| Expenses ACCESS | line.coa_code | funding COA |
| PRF | 5200 Partner Rebate | funding COA |
| CALF | 1110 AR BDM | funding COA |
| Payroll | 6000/6050/5100/6060 | 2200-2230 + Cash/Bank |
| AP (SI Post) | 1200 Inventory + 1210 VAT | 2000 AP Trade |
| AP Payment | 2000 AP Trade | Cash/Bank |
| Depreciation | 7000 Depreciation | 1350 Accum. Depr. |
| Interest | 7050 Interest | 2300 Loans Payable |
| IC Transfer (sender) | 1150 IC Receivable | 1200 Inventory |
| IC Transfer (receiver) | 1200 Inventory | 2050 IC Payable |
| Commission | 5100 BDM Commission | 1110 AR BDM |
| Inventory Write-Off | 6850 Inventory Write-Off | 1200 Inventory |
| Inventory Adj Gain | 1200 Inventory | 6860 Inventory Adj Gain |
| Petty Cash | 6XXX Expense | 1015 Petty Cash |
| Owner Infusion | Cash/Bank | 3000 Owner Capital |
| Owner Drawing | 3100 Owner Drawings | Cash/Bank |

### Funding COA Resolution

`resolveFundingCoa(doc)` in `autoJournal.js` resolves credit-side COA:
1. `funding_card_id` → CreditCard.coa_code
2. `funding_account_id` or `bank_account_id` → BankAccount.coa_code
3. `payment_mode` → PaymentMode.coa_code
4. Fallback: 1000 (Cash on Hand)

## Key Services

| Service | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `autoJournal.js` | `backend/erp/services/autoJournal.js` | 15 `journalFrom*()` functions — return JE data objects (not persisted) |
| `journalEngine.js` | `backend/erp/services/journalEngine.js` | `createAndPostJournal()`, `reverseJournal()`, `getGeneralLedger()` |
| `fifoEngine.js` | `backend/erp/services/fifoEngine.js` | FIFO consumption for sales, returns `{ batch_lot_no, expiry_date, qty_consumed }` |
| `arEngine.js` | `backend/erp/services/arEngine.js` | AR computation from source docs (SalesLine + Collection), NOT from GL |
| `trialBalanceService.js` | `backend/erp/services/trialBalanceService.js` | Aggregates from POSTED JournalEntry lines |
| `pnlService.js` | `backend/erp/services/pnlService.js` | P&L from JournalEntries (GL-based, authoritative) |
| `pnlCalc.js` | `backend/erp/services/pnlCalc.js` | Legacy P&L from source documents (used for year-end close) |
| `vatService.js` | `backend/erp/services/vatService.js` | VAT ledger CRUD, `computeVatReturn2550Q()` |
| `cwtService.js` | `backend/erp/services/cwtService.js` | CWT ledger CRUD, `computeCwt2307Summary()` |
| `monthEndClose.js` | `backend/erp/services/monthEndClose.js` | 29-step SOP (Phases 1-7), depreciation/interest posting works, Phase 3 journal posting is stub |

---

## Common ERP Gotchas

1. **autoJournal functions return data objects** (not persisted). Caller must call `createAndPostJournal(entityId, jeData)`.
2. **`source_event_id`** on JournalEntry links JE to TransactionEvent — used for reversal lookup on reopen.
3. **ProductMaster.purchase_price** drives COGS — if zero, COGS JE will have zero amount.
4. **VAT/CWT ledger entries** are separate from journal entries — they feed VAT Return (2550Q) and CWT Summary (2307) pages.
5. **Dual P&L**: `pnlService.js` (GL-based) vs `pnlCalc.js` (source-doc-based). `pnlService` is authoritative; `pnlCalc` used for legacy year-end close.
6. **AR Engine vs GL mismatch risk**: `arEngine.js` computes from source docs, `trialBalanceService.js` from JEs. They can diverge if JEs fail.
7. **CALF gate**: Expenses with `calf_required=true` cannot be posted until linked CALF is POSTED (enforced in `submitExpenses` and `submitCarLogbook`).
8. **Period lock**: `checkPeriodOpen()` prevents posting to closed/locked months. Import from `../utils/periodLock`.
9. **Product dropdown format**: All dropdowns must show `brand_name dosage — qty unit_code` (dosage required, never omit).
10. **IC_TRANSFER** source_module — added to JournalEntry enum for inter-company transfer JEs.

## Batch Expense Upload (Phase 20)

President/admin-only feature for bulk receipt processing:
- `POST /expenses/ore-access/batch-upload` — up to 20 images, OCR → classify COA → assorted items (3+ line items)
- `POST /expenses/ore-access/batch-save` — save reviewed lines as DRAFT
- Setup: BIR flag, category, employee, cost center, funding (card/bank), period/cycle
- `bir_flag` passthrough: `submitExpenses` and `submitPrfCalf` use `entry.bir_flag || 'BOTH'`
- President override via `recorded_on_behalf_of` bypasses CALF requirement
- COA dropdown loads from API (`GET /api/erp/coa`) — scalable, not hardcoded

### COA Export/Import
- `GET /api/erp/coa/export?format=xlsx` — Excel download (Google Sheets compatible)
- `GET /api/erp/coa/export?format=json` — JSON download
- `POST /api/erp/coa/import` — accepts Excel file upload OR JSON body, upserts by account_code

### Multi-Business-Line COA (Pharma + F&B + Rental)
VIP runs three business lines under one entity, tracked by cost centers:
- **Pharma**: 4000-4100 Revenue, 5000-5300 COGS, 6000-6600 OpEx
- **F&B (Balai Lawaan)**: 4300 F&B Revenue, 5400 Food Cost, 5500 Beverage Cost, 6830-6840 F&B OpEx
- **Rental (Balai Lawaan)**: 4400-4500 Rental Income (Short/Long), 6870-6890 Property OpEx

## Remaining Known Gaps (P2 — Not Critical)

| Gap | Description | Impact |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Dual P&L deprecation | pnlCalc vs pnlService coexist without reconciliation | Consistency risk |
| Commission controller | No dedicated controller — wired inline in collectionController | Works, not clean |

---

## ERP Routes
