## Overview

Full ERP system under `backend/erp/` and `frontend/src/erp/`. Multi-entity pharmaceutical distribution ERP with SAP-inspired patterns.

### Architecture
- **Multi-entity**: VIP (parent) + MG AND CO. (subsidiary). Entity-scoped data via `req.entityId`.
- **Document lifecycle**: DRAFT → VALID → ERROR → POSTED (SAP Park→Check→Post)
- **MongoDB transactions** for all posting operations
- **Double-entry accounting**: JournalEntry model with DR=CR validation on pre-save
- **Period locking**: `checkPeriodOpen()` prevents posting to closed months

---

## Entity Model

VIP is the parent company, supplies subsidiaries (MG AND CO. INC. first). BDMs can graduate to own subsidiary. Scalability is critical — every model is scoped by `entity_id`.

- `req.entityId` — resolved from user's assigned entity
- `req.bdmId` — the BDM user (for BDM-scoped queries)
- `req.tenantFilter` — `{ entity_id: req.entityId, bdm_id: req.bdmId }` (convenience)

## Governance Principles

This ERP is a top-down, lookup-driven business operating system. It must scale across entities, subsidiaries, business lines, departments, and people without relying on hardcoded values in code or UI.

- **President/Admin/Finance own control**: They define and maintain the core business structure for entities, people, roles, reporting lines, cost centers, permissions, funding sources, banks, cards, Chart of Accounts, and other lookup/master data.
- **Master data flows downward**: Employees and operational users work inside the structure created by president/admin/finance. Transactions, approvals, reporting, and visibility all inherit from that structure.
- **No hardcoded business options**: Dropdowns, mappings, permissions, and posting references should come from controlled master data and API lookups wherever possible, not fixed frontend constants or one-off backend conditions.
- **Entity-first design**: All scalable features must respect entity boundaries and support future subsidiaries, inter-company activity, and shared parent oversight.
- **People-first design**: System behavior depends on properly structured people data — who belongs to which entity, who reports to whom, who can approve, and who can view or act on each module.
- **Finance-authoritative outputs**: Posted accounting data, controlled journals, and approved master data are the source of truth for financial reports, compliance, and cross-module reconciliation.

In practice, the system is dependent on president/admin/finance maintaining clean entity structure and people structure. If those foundations are incomplete or inconsistent, downstream modules will become unreliable.

## Accounting Engine (Phase 11)

### Auto-Journal on POST

Every submit/post controller creates journal entries via `autoJournal.js` → `journalEngine.createAndPostJournal(entityId, jeData)`. JE creation is non-blocking (after MongoDB transaction, wrapped in try/catch).

### JE Reversal on REOPEN

All reopen functions call `journalEngine.reverseJournal()` (SAP Storno pattern: creates a new JE with flipped DR/CR amounts, original stays POSTED, reversal links via `corrects_je_id`). VAT/CWT ledger entries cleaned up on reopen.

### COA Mapping

| Transaction | Debit | Credit |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Sale (CSI) | 1100 AR Trade | 4000 Revenue + 2100 VAT |
| COGS | 5000 COGS | 1200 Inventory |
| Service Revenue | 1100 AR Trade | 4100 Service Revenue |
| Collection | Cash/Bank (resolved) | 1100 AR Trade |
| CWT | 1220 CWT Receivable | 1100 AR Trade |
| SMER | 6100/6150/6160/6170 | 1110 AR BDM |
| Car Logbook | 6200 Fuel | 1110 or funding COA |
| Expenses ORE | line.coa_code | 1110 AR BDM |
| Expenses ACCESS | line.coa_code | funding COA |
| PRF | 5200 Partner Rebate | funding COA |
| CALF | 1110 AR BDM | funding COA |
| Payroll | 6000/6050/5100/6060 | 2200-2230 + Cash/Bank |
| AP (SI Post) | 1200 Inventory + 1210 VAT | 2000 AP Trade |
| AP Payment | 2000 AP Trade | Cash/Bank |
| Depreciation | 7000 Depreciation | 1350 Accum. Depr. |
| Interest | 7050 Interest | 2300 Loans Payable |
| IC Transfer (sender) | 1150 IC Receivable | 1200 Inventory |
| IC Transfer (receiver) | 1200 Inventory | 2050 IC Payable |
| Commission | 5100 BDM Commission | 1110 AR BDM |
| Inventory Write-Off | 6850 Inventory Write-Off | 1200 Inventory |
| Inventory Adj Gain | 1200 Inventory | 6860 Inventory Adj Gain |
| Petty Cash | 6XXX Expense | 1015 Petty Cash |
| Owner Infusion | Cash/Bank | 3000 Owner Capital |
| Owner Drawing | 3100 Owner Drawings | Cash/Bank |

### Funding COA Resolution

`resolveFundingCoa(doc)` in `autoJournal.js` resolves credit-side COA:
1. `funding_card_id` → CreditCard.coa_code
2. `funding_account_id` or `bank_account_id` → BankAccount.coa_code
3. `payment_mode` → PaymentMode.coa_code
4. Fallback: 1000 (Cash on Hand)

## Key Services

| Service | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `autoJournal.js` | `backend/erp/services/autoJournal.js` | 15 `journalFrom*()` functions — return JE data objects (not persisted) |
| `journalEngine.js` | `backend/erp/services/journalEngine.js` | `createAndPostJournal()`, `reverseJournal()`, `getGeneralLedger()` |
| `fifoEngine.js` | `backend/erp/services/fifoEngine.js` | FIFO consumption for sales, returns `{ batch_lot_no, expiry_date, qty_consumed }` |
| `arEngine.js` | `backend/erp/services/arEngine.js` | AR computation from source docs (SalesLine + Collection), NOT from GL |
| `trialBalanceService.js` | `backend/erp/services/trialBalanceService.js` | Aggregates from POSTED JournalEntry lines |
| `pnlService.js` | `backend/erp/services/pnlService.js` | P&L from JournalEntries (GL-based, authoritative) |
| `pnlCalc.js` | `backend/erp/services/pnlCalc.js` | Legacy P&L from source documents (used for year-end close) |
| `vatService.js` | `backend/erp/services/vatService.js` | VAT ledger CRUD, `computeVatReturn2550Q()` |
| `cwtService.js` | `backend/erp/services/cwtService.js` | CWT ledger CRUD, `computeCwt2307Summary()` |
| `monthEndClose.js` | `backend/erp/services/monthEndClose.js` | 29-step SOP (Phases 1-7), depreciation/interest posting works, Phase 3 journal posting is stub |

---

## Common ERP Gotchas

1. **autoJournal functions return data objects** (not persisted). Caller must call `createAndPostJournal(entityId, jeData)`.
2. **`source_event_id`** on JournalEntry links JE to TransactionEvent — used for reversal lookup on reopen.
3. **ProductMaster.purchase_price** drives COGS — if zero, COGS JE will have zero amount.
4. **VAT/CWT ledger entries** are separate from journal entries — they feed VAT Return (2550Q) and CWT Summary (2307) pages.
5. **Dual P&L**: `pnlService.js` (GL-based) vs `pnlCalc.js` (source-doc-based). `pnlService` is authoritative; `pnlCalc` used for legacy year-end close.
6. **AR Engine vs GL mismatch risk**: `arEngine.js` computes from source docs, `trialBalanceService.js` from JEs. They can diverge if JEs fail.
7. **CALF gate**: Expenses with `calf_required=true` cannot be posted until linked CALF is POSTED (enforced in `submitExpenses` and `submitCarLogbook`).
8. **Period lock**: `checkPeriodOpen()` prevents posting to closed/locked months. Import from `../utils/periodLock`.
9. **Product dropdown format**: All dropdowns must show `brand_name dosage — qty unit_code` (dosage required, never omit).
10. **IC_TRANSFER** source_module — added to JournalEntry enum for inter-company transfer JEs.

---

## Batch Expense Upload (Phase 20)

President/admin-only feature for bulk receipt processing:
- `POST /expenses/ore-access/batch-upload` — up to 20 images, OCR → classify COA → assorted items (3+ line items)
- `POST /expenses/ore-access/batch-save` — save reviewed lines as DRAFT
- Setup: BIR flag, category, employee, cost center, funding (card/bank), period/cycle
- `bir_flag` passthrough: `submitExpenses` and `submitPrfCalf` use `entry.bir_flag || 'BOTH'`
- President override via `recorded_on_behalf_of` bypasses CALF requirement
- COA dropdown loads from API (`GET /api/erp/coa`) — scalable, not hardcoded

### COA Export/Import
- `GET /api/erp/coa/export?format=xlsx` — Excel download (Google Sheets compatible)
- `GET /api/erp/coa/export?format=json` — JSON download
- `POST /api/erp/coa/import` — accepts Excel file upload OR JSON body, upserts by account_code

### Multi-Business-Line COA (Pharma + F&B + Rental)
VIP runs three business lines under one entity, tracked by cost centers:
- **Pharma**: 4000-4100 Revenue, 5000-5300 COGS, 6000-6600 OpEx
- **F&B (Balai Lawaan)**: 4300 F&B Revenue, 5400 Food Cost, 5500 Beverage Cost, 6830-6840 F&B OpEx
- **Rental (Balai Lawaan)**: 4400-4500 Rental Income (Short/Long), 6870-6890 Property OpEx

## Remaining Known Gaps (P2 — Not Critical)

| Gap | Description | Impact |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Dual P&L deprecation | pnlCalc vs pnlService coexist without reconciliation | Consistency risk |
| Commission controller | No dedicated controller — wired inline in collectionController | Works, not clean |
| VAT 0.12 in pre-save hooks | SalesLine, ExpenseEntry, Collection etc. hardcode 12% in schema hooks | Cannot change per entity; low risk until rate changes |
| Frontend hardcoded dropdowns | ~30 static arrays (expense categories, collateral types, activity types) serve as fallbacks | Phase 24 added Lookup model + LookupManager UI + useLookups hook. Migration of individual pages to use lookups is a follow-up task |
| Hospital entity_id optional | Hospitals intentionally global (shared across entities) | By design, but undocumented in schema |

---

## ERP Routes

All ERP routes mounted under `/api/erp/` via `backend/erp/routes/erpRouter.js`. Sub-module access controlled by `erpAccessCheck(moduleName)` middleware.

| Route Prefix | Controller | Module Key |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| `/sales` | salesController | sales |
| `/collections` | collectionController | collections |
| `/expenses` | expenseController | expenses |
| `/inventory` | inventoryController | inventory |
| `/purchasing` | purchasingController | purchasing |
| `/payroll` | payrollController | payroll |
| `/accounting` | accountingController | accounting |
| `/banking` | bankingController | banking |
| `/people` | peopleController | people |
| `/reports` | erpReportController | reports |
| `/settings` | settingsController | settings |
| `/entities` | entityController | (shared) |
| `/control-center` | controlCenterController | (shared) |
| `/lookup-values` | lookupGenericController | (shared) |

---

## ERP Control Center (Phase 24)

Single page at `/erp/control-center` for president/admin/finance. Consolidates all configuration, master data, and governance settings into one place organized by the governance hierarchy.

### Architecture
- Container page with left category sidebar + lazy-loaded content panels
- Each existing config page exports a `*Content` named export (no Navbar/Sidebar wrapper) for embedding
- Standalone routes (`/erp/coa`, `/erp/bank-accounts`, etc.) remain fully functional
- URL sync via `?section=xxx` query params for deep-linking

### Category Structure (8 groups)
1. **Foundation Health** — Overview dashboard showing completeness of each governance layer
2. **Entity & Organization** — Entity CRUD (first-ever UI for managing entities)
3. **People & Access** — People Master + Access Templates
4. **Financial Setup** — COA, Cost Centers, Bank Accounts, Credit Cards, Payment Modes
5. **Tax & Compliance** — Government Rates
6. **Operations** — Warehouses, Transfer Prices, Fixed Assets
7. **Governance Controls** — Period Locks, Recurring Journals, Data Archive
8. **System Settings** — ERP Settings (~30 fields) + Lookup Tables (16 categories)

### New Models
- `Lookup` (`backend/erp/models/Lookup.js`) — generic entity-scoped lookup table (category + code + label + sort_order). Replaces hardcoded frontend arrays with database-driven lookups. Unique index: `{ entity_id, category, code }`.

### New Hooks
- `useLookups(category)` (`frontend/src/erp/hooks/useLookups.js`) — fetches + caches lookup values by category with 5-minute TTL. Returns `{ options, loading }`.

## Workflow Guide & Dependency Guide Governance

Every user-facing page MUST have a helper banner. Two systems exist — use one per page, never both.

### WorkflowGuide — for standalone pages

Used on transaction, reporting, and management pages (Sales, Collections, GRN, Hospitals, etc.).

- **Config**: `frontend/src/erp/components/WorkflowGuide.jsx` → `WORKFLOW_GUIDES` object
- **Structure**: Each pageKey has `title`, `steps[]` (numbered), `next[]` (links), optional `tip`
- **Usage**: Import and render `<WorkflowGuide pageKey="..." />` at top of page content
- **Dismissal**: Session-based via `sessionStorage` (key: `wfg_dismiss_{pageKey}`)

### DEPENDENCY_GUIDE — for Control Center panels only

Used on embedded panels inside ControlCenter (Entities, COA, Warehouses, Agent Config, etc.).

- **Config**: `frontend/src/erp/pages/ControlCenter.jsx` → `DEPENDENCY_GUIDE` object
- **Structure**: Each section key has `title`, `items[]` (action → deps → optional section link)
- **Rendered by**: `DependencyBanner` component inside ControlCenter

### Rule: Always Update Guides When Modifying Pages

When creating or modifying any ERP page, you MUST also update the corresponding guide:

1. **New standalone page** → add a pageKey entry to `WORKFLOW_GUIDES` + import WorkflowGuide in the page
2. **New Control Center section** → add entry to `DEPENDENCY_GUIDE` in ControlCenter.jsx
3. **Modified page workflow** → update the steps/tips/next-links in the guide to match the new behavior
4. **Removed page** → remove the guide entry to avoid dead references

### Lint Check

Run `node scripts/check-workflow-guides.js` to verify all pages have either WorkflowGuide or DEPENDENCY_GUIDE coverage. Exit code 1 = gaps found. This should be run after adding or modifying ERP pages.
